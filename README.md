I'm a recent master's graduate in Computer Science with a passion for creating impactful user experiences and sleek front-end designs. My academic journey has been marked by a deep dive into UX/UI research, front-end development, cloud computing, and blockchain technology.

I find joy in the intricacies of design and the endless possibilities of technology. My work as a teaching assistant at my faculty has not only honed my technical skills but also my ability to explain complex concepts with ease.

When I'm not coding or designing, you'll find me immersed in the latest tech trends or exploring new learning opportunities. I believe that continuous learning is the key to staying at the forefront of technological innovation.

On my GitHub, you'll find a mix of projects showcasing my journey in front-end development, experiments in cloud computing, and my explorations in blockchain. Feel free to reach out if you're interested in collaborating or just want to chat about tech!"
